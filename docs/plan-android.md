# The Android app, as a product

`docs/plan-phones.md` put the Kotlin client on the phone and rewired the
app to it; what it rewired was an engineer's app — a settings screen of
counters, an alone switch, dev sign-in by typing a name. This is the
design that makes it harken. Android only for now; iOS mirrors it later.

## Decided by the owner

- **harken is never used without a server.** The demo web UI is the one
  server-less client. The Android app has no alone mode: no switch, no
  path that opens a replica with no server behind it.
- **Onboarding is shared, and is three steps**: the server's address,
  signing in through the server's OAuth in a browser tab, then the
  permissions the app needs — for harken, only notifications, which is
  what lets the player show its notification and lock-screen controls.
  It remembers the server and the person and never asks again; signing
  out, or the server refusing the session, brings back only the steps
  that are needed.
- **The debug information is out of the way.** Nothing a person sees in
  ordinary use is a cursor, a hash or a count of pending intents.
- **Home, Search, Library and the player are designed**, not listed.

## The shared onboarding: `kotlin/ark-android`

An Android library module beside `ark-runtime` and `ark-client`, package
`dev.arkdb.android`, that any Ark app on Android uses — harken is its
first caller and names only what is harken's:

```kotlin
ArkApp(
    identity = AppIdentity(name = "Harken", scheme = "harken", mark = painterResource(R.drawable.mark)),
    permissions = listOf(Permission.Notifications(why = "Show what's playing and its controls")),
) { session -> HarkenScreens(session) }
```

- **Server.** One field. Accepts `host`, `host:port`, or a URL; tries
  `https` and, for a private or loopback address, `http`; asks the
  server's `/healthz` and goes on only when the answer is an Ark server
  serving this app's module. Errors say which of those failed, in a
  sentence.
- **Sign in.** Opens the server's `/auth/login?redirect=<scheme>://auth`
  in a Custom Tab; the server is the OAuth client (`ark-auth`), so the
  phone holds no secret and knows no provider, and a dev server's own
  sign-in page works the same way. `<scheme>://auth?code=…` comes back to
  the activity, the code is exchanged at `/auth/exchange`, and the login —
  user, session, token, roles — is remembered.
- **Permissions.** One screen per permission the app declares, each with
  the app's reason in a sentence, "Allow" and "Not now". A permission the
  platform does not have (notifications below Android 13) is skipped.
  Asked once; never again unless the person goes to settings.
- **Remembered.** Server and login in the app's private storage; on
  launch with both, straight into the app. A `Denied` from the server
  (revoked, expired) returns to *Sign in* with the server kept and the
  replica and its pending intents kept, so signing in as the same person
  pushes them. *Sign out* forgets the login, keeps the server.
- **The session** it hands the app is the Kotlin `Peer` opened over that
  server, pumped on its own thread, with the status a screen may ask for
  (`linked`, `pending > 0`) and nothing else by default.

## harken on Android

- **Home**: what was played last and a way back to it; recently added;
  the person's playlists; albums — shelves of covers, each opening its
  page.
- **Search**: one field over the library's `search` (the text index), as
  you type, results grouped as songs, albums, artists; recent searches.
- **Library**: Playlists, Albums, Artists, Songs, and the pages each
  opens (a playlist, an album with its track order and sections, an
  artist with their albums); create a playlist, add to and remove from
  one.
- **The player**: Media3's ExoPlayer in a `MediaSessionService`, streaming
  `/media/…` from the server — the notification, the lock screen and
  Bluetooth controls are the media session's. A mini player above the
  tab bar; a full-screen player it grows into, with the cover, the
  title, a scrubber, previous / play-pause / next, shuffle, repeat and
  the queue.
- **Settings**: the account, the server, sign out, about. Diagnostics —
  every number the old settings screen had — behind *About*: tap the
  version seven times, as Android's own build number does.
- **Look**: harken's palette — the desktop's neutrals and its gold — in a
  light and a dark theme, the same type scale throughout.

## Proving it without a phone

No phone or emulator runs here, so the screens are rendered on the JVM
(Paparazzi, or Roborazzi if Paparazzi cannot be built offline) in light
and dark from a fixed demo library, and the PNGs are a nix output
(`packages.harken-android-screens`) — what the owner looks at, and what a
change to a screen is reviewed by. The onboarding's state machine, the
address handling and the remembered store are unit tests.

## Landed

All of it, in five commits (`git log -- kotlin/ark-android harken/android`):
the shared onboarding; harken without an alone mode; the player, the
screens and the look together (each needed the others to compile); the
screens as images; and the recorded graph with these docs. What each
screen is, what was added and why, what was broken on purpose to see a
test fail, and what nobody has seen yet.

### `kotlin/ark-android`

`ArkApp(identity, permissions) { session -> … }`, as above, with two
changes to the sketch: `AppIdentity` also carries the app's two colour
schemes, its type and its module (the onboarding's health check compares
the module's hash, and the session interprets it), and `Permission` is an
open class rather than a sealed one, so the next app's need is its own
declaration. Under the screens is a pure machine — `Onboarding.next(step,
event)` returning the step and the effects — that `ArkHost`, a
`ViewModel`, runs. The intent filter for `<scheme>://auth` is the app's
manifest's, on a `singleTask` activity; `ArkApp` takes the code from the
launch intent and from every new intent (`addOnNewIntentListener`), and a
return to the activity with no code puts the button back. `ArkSession` is
the peer on its own thread with `status`, `post`, `run`, `onPump` and
`signOut`. Documented in `kotlin/README.md`.

### harken's screens

- **Onboarding** (the module's, in harken's identity): the server field
  with its sentence under it — unreachable, not an Ark server, an Ark
  server for another app; signing in, waiting for the browser,
  exchanging, or back after a denial with the server's reason; the
  notification permission with harken's reason.
- **Home**: the last played track and where from, with a button that plays
  that list again from it; recently added; your playlists; albums. Empty,
  it says where music comes from; before the first read, that it is
  opening; unreachable, a sentence over it.
- **Search**: as you type, songs from the module's `search`, albums and
  artists by name; recent searches when empty; "nothing matches" when
  nothing does.
- **Library**: Playlists (with "New playlist"), Albums (a grid), Artists,
  Songs — each with its own empty sentence.
- **Album / artist / playlist pages**: header with cover, kind, name, who
  by (a link to the artist), the counts and length, Play and Shuffle; an
  album in sections by part with release track numbers; an artist's albums
  shelf then songs; a playlist that is empty or gone says so.
- **A song's menu, adding to a playlist, a new playlist** (validated as
  typed by `create_playlist`'s checks, the module's sentence inline).
- **The player**: the mini player above the tab bar, the full player, the
  queue sheet.
- **Settings** and **diagnostics** (seven taps on the version; listed
  under About once found).

### Dependencies added, and why

- `androidx.browser:browser:1.8.0` — the Custom Tab the sign-in opens in.
- `androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer:1.5.1`, `media3-session:1.5.1` — the
  player, and the media session that is the notification, the lock screen
  and Bluetooth. 1.5.1, of the same months as the rest of this graph
  (AGP 8.7, the Compose BOM of 2024.12), whose `compileSdk 35` it fits.
- `app.cash.paparazzi` 1.3.5 (test only), and through it layoutlib 14 —
  the screenshots. 1.3.5 because it is the release built against Kotlin
  2.0.21, which this build uses.
- `junit:junit:4.13.2` (test only) — the onboarding's and the app's JVM
  tests; Paparazzi runs under it.
- No image library: covers are `HttpURLConnection` and `BitmapFactory`.
- `material-icons-core` was dropped: every glyph is the desktop's Lucide
  path.

### Falsified

Each test was broken on purpose once and seen to fail:

- `OnboardingTests`: a denial that did not forget the dead login —
  `deniedWhileRunningGoesBackToSignInKeepingTheServer` failed.
- `ServerTests`: every host taken as local (`addresses`, `probing`
  failed); any Ark server accepted whatever its module (`health`,
  `probing`); `markAsked` overwriting the others (`remembered`); an https
  answer that refused retried in the clear (`probing`).
- `MediaTests`: segments not percent-encoded; the square's hash walked
  over code points instead of UTF-16 units (the emoji pin failed);
  `sampleSize` shrinking below what is wanted; a clock with no hours.
- `Screens`: a mini player that throws — the seven tests that draw it
  failed, and `recordPaparazziDebug` with them.

### What ran green here

- `nix build .#checks.x86_64-linux.kotlin` — ktfmt over the runtime, the
  client, `ark-android` and `harken-peer`; 122 of 130 vectors; the trace
  corpus; `KeptNumbers`, `StoreHints`, `ClientTests`, `StorageTests`.
  The runtime and the client did not change.
- `nix build .#harken-apk` — the onboarding's 11 JVM tests, then
  `assembleDebug`: `result/harken-debug.apk`, 13,748,869 bytes, debug-signed.
- `nix build .#harken-android-screens` — 80 PNGs (40 screens and states,
  light and dark, 1080×2340) and `index.html`, all looked at.
- On a laptop gradle (the flake's SDK and JDK): `MediaTests` (4) and the
  same `Screens` rendering.
- The recording (`harken-apk-deps`) ran its three tasks green against the
  network. Its script needs a nix daemon to reach (it runs `nix-shell`
  inside bubblewrap), and `nix run` here wants a `bin/`, so it was run as
  the store path it builds. Building from the new graph met Maven
  Central's 429 on one artifact (`paparazzi-gradle-plugin-1.3.5.jar`)
  through every retry; it was put in the store from Google's mirror of
  Maven Central, under the same name, after checking its SHA-256 against
  `deps.json` — the store path of a flat fixed output is its name and its
  hash, so that is the same path the fetch would have made.

### Not verified

No phone or emulator has run any of this. In particular: that the Custom
Tab's redirect reaches the `singleTask` activity on a real device (and
that a server with a real provider, not the dev form, sends it there);
that Media3 shows its notification and lock-screen controls and answers
Bluetooth; that `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is asked at the right moment on
Android 13+ and skipped below; streaming and seeking over `/media` from a
real server; covers from a real server (the screenshots draw only the
derived squares); how the full player animates in and out; the
diagnostics' numbers against a live peer. The screenshots are layoutlib's
rendering of the composables — faithful to layout, type and colour, not to
a device's insets, fonts or animation — and the sheets and the dialog are
framed over a scrim there rather than raised as windows.
